# Tartines

Tools for **building**, **simulating**, and **analyzing** water–solid interfaces.

`tartines` provides a lightweight workflow for:
- Constructing atomistic water–solid interface models
- Running molecular simulations using external engines (e.g., ASE-compatible calculators)
- Post-processing density profiles, structural metrics, and interface properties

## Features

- ✓ Interface builder utilities
- ✓ Automated input generation for simulations
- ✓ Analysis tools:
  - Density profiles (O/H)
  - Structural statistics

## Installation

Clone and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoR4uch/tartine.git
